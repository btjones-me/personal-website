My work sits at the intersection of AI, product, and engineering — turning complex machine learning and AI into reliable, safe, and commercially impactful solutions.

In addition to my day job, I advise startups on AI, ML, and data science strategy — helping them design, build, and operationalise intelligent systems, and have spoken at a number of conferences including as a main stage speaker at Google Cloud's London Summit in 2024 and Big Data London in 2025.

Before Motorway, I led ML at computer vision startup DeGould and worked as a technical consultant for 4 years across Accenture, Anglo American, and the UK’s Ministry of Defence. My consulting experiences allowed me to hone my ability to spot commercial opportunity — and I take pride in ensuring every AI initiative is grounded in adding real business or user value. 

With a hands-on foundation in data science and ML engineering, my focus more recently has been on delivering transformational experiences with agentic generative AI systems. I’m passionate about building high-performing teams and creating ethical, scalable AI systems that drive real impact.""",
